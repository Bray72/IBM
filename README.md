Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using NLP

Project Overview

This project aims to analyze movie reviews from the IMDB dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With the support of IBM Granite Models, text reviews are processed to determine whether they express a positive or negative sentiment, while also generating short explanations for classification.

Main objectives:

* Classify sentiment (positive / negative).
* Discover insights about factors influencing reviews.
* Demonstrate the use of AI in analyzing unstructured text data.
